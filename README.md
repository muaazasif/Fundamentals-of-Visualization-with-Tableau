Find or create a simple data source and put the data in tabular format into a Google Sheet. Your data source must include at least 10 rows of data and at least 4 columns describing that data. For example, you could describe 10 activities you do in a day including what each activity is called, when you start each activity, when you finish each, and how happy you were when doing that activity. The grain of this data would be one row per activity.

Using the Charts feature of Google Sheets, create a new sheet in this same file, create a simple visualization of this data using a minimum of 2 colors, and be sure to label your data points.

When you are finished with your viz, please respond to these two prompts on another new sheet in this same file:
